1. Batch normalization can lead to a faster, more stable convergence with higher accuracy.
2. However, the advantages will come at the expense of training time – batch normalization will
require more “wall time” to train the network, even though the network will obtain higher
accuracy in less epochs.
That said, the extra training time often outweighs the negatives, and I highly encourage you to
apply batch normalization to your own network architectures.
